Currently building peach  helping businesses slide into their customers' WhatsApp DMs (professionally, of course). We're making business growth as sweet as a perfectly ripe peach!

Previously co-founded Gumstack, where we made video calling so easy, your grandma could integrate it into her cookie business website in under 5 minutes. Think face-to-face customer conversations without the awkward "can you hear me now?" moments. (Currently hibernating in the startup garden ðŸ˜´)

Also wore the founding member hat at InterviewPass, where we revolutionized the interview process with async superpowers. Helped companies evaluate candidates while everyone stayed in their pajamas. Sadly, this project has graduated to the great startup sky. RIP InterviewPass ðŸŒŸ
