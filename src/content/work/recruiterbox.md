Ninja'd my way through product development using design sprints 🏃‍♂️, turning monster-sized problems into bite-sized features. Because Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither was a killer recruiting platform! Helped customers find their perfect candidates without losing their sanity.

Played superhero in the support squad 🦸‍♂️, swooping in to save customers from their technical troubles. While our Indian engineering team caught their well-deserved Z's, we kept the support fires burning and bugs running for cover. No customer left behind!

Currently wearing the growth hacker hat 🎯, turning our website into a lead-generating machine through the power of A/B testing. Created more landing pages than a rocket has launches, and crafted content marketing materials that actually get read. Because who said recruitment software can't be exciting?
