Architected a snazzy web 2.0 application that made the Digital Re-Imagination initiative actually imaginative! ðŸŽ¨ Took the previous version from "meh" to "wow" by sprinkling some modern magic on usability, maintainability, and interoperability. Embraced Ruby on Rails' "convention over configuration" philosophy like a warm hug, while Agile methodology kept us dancing to the beat of rapid development. ðŸš€

Crafted a hybrid mobile app that turned boring financial data into eye-candy visualizations. Wielded D3 like a digital paintbrush and made dimple.js sing, while Apache Cordova played matchmaker between web and mobile. ðŸ“Š Because who said financial data can't be fun?

Masterminded a survey solution that does everything except make coffee â˜• (we're working on that feature). From crafting questions to collecting responses through every channel imaginable, we turned raw data into business gold. Built a data-crunching machine that makes sense of both structured and unstructured feedback, because sometimes the best insights come from the messiest data! ðŸ“ˆ
