Last week, I realized something I’ve always cautioned against: using overly rigid prompts for our LLM-driven customer support bot. Essentially, we were taking a high-performance vehicle and forcing it onto a single-track rail, unable to maneuver freely where it excelled most.

## The “Aha” Moment

During a recent review, we encountered a user seeking to reschedule an appointment, complicated by an international trip to a different time zone. Our meticulously defined prompt structure gave a formally correct but practically useless answer about local time slots—completely ignoring their unique travel scenario.

Below is our original setup:

```ruby
# Before: Overly Restrictive
def handle_scheduling(request)
  response = llm.complete(
    prompt: "TIME_SLOT_TEMPLATE",
    parameters: {
      date: request.date,
      time: request.time,
      action: "RESCHEDULE"
    }
  )
end
```

Now, here’s the updated version:

```ruby
# After: Letting AI Shine
def handle_scheduling(request)
  response = llm.complete(
    prompt: "You're a helpful scheduling assistant. The customer needs assistance with: #{request}. 
            Consider their situation, time zones, and preferences, while keeping a natural dialog."
  )
end
```

The change was dramatic. Instead of rigidly following a template, our AI started asking the right questions, understanding user circumstances, and even coming up with alternative suggestions we hadn’t considered before.

## Why Does This Happen?

It’s understandable. We often want to control every detail to ensure reliability and predictability. Sadly, this approach ends up:

1. Neglecting the most powerful feature of LLMs—their capacity to interpret context and adapt.
2. Piling extra work on our shoulders.
3. Diminishing the user’s overall experience.

## Breaking Free: What Works Better

After months of trial and error, here’s what made the difference:

1. **Trust the Process**  
   Instead of micromanaging each interaction, clarify goals and boundaries and let the AI navigate how to reach them.

2. **Embrace Variation**  
   Users differ in preferences, tone, and needs. Modern LLMs excel at customizing responses if allowed freedom.

3. **Measure Success, Not Layout**  
   Concentrate on whether solutions are effective, not whether they follow a rigid script.

## A Real-World Example

Here’s an example from our appointment booking process:

```ruby
# Old Method: Step-by-Step Script
def book_appointment
  steps = [
    "ASK_DATE",
    "VALIDATE_DATE",
    "ASK_TIME",
    "VALIDATE_TIME",
    "CONFIRM_BOOKING"
  ]
  
  steps.each do |step|
    execute_step(step)
  end
end

# New Method: Natural Interaction
def book_appointment
  context = {
    available_slots: get_available_slots(),
    user_timezone: detect_user_timezone(),
    scheduling_preferences: get_user_preferences()
  }
  
  llm.interact(
    system_prompt: "Help schedule an appointment in the best possible way. 
                   Be mindful of the user’s time zone and preferences.",
    context: context
  )
end
```

## Taking It Forward

Whenever you’re setting up an LLM-based solution, ask yourself: “Am I empowering the AI or just imposing a strict checklist?” 

Our ultimate goal is to solve real-world problems and support users effectively. Sometimes, giving the AI more freedom is exactly what’s needed to accomplish that.
