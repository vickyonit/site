Hey!

Thanks for checking out my blog.

I like to write about things I learn in my roles of being a programmer, dad, husband and wanna be financially educated fellow.

I believe in reading a lot, now I am at a point to pass these knowledge I can for others and for myself to understand how my perspective may or may not have changed over time.

Keeping this post short. See you soon!

Cheers!
